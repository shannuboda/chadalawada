                            <b>Introduction</b><br><br>
                            Biomedical Engineering is the application of Engineering concepts and techniques in the
                            field of Medicine. It combines the problem solving capability of engineers with the medical
                            expertise of physicians to enhance the quality of life through health care process.
                            Biomedical engineers bridge the medical and engineering disciplines to provide an overall
                            enhancement in the quality of health care and products.<br /><br />

                            Rajalakshmi Engineering College has established the Department of Biomedical Engineering in

                            Biomedical engineers use their expertise in biology, medicine, physics, mathematics,
                            engineering science and communication to make the world a healthier place. The challenges
                            created by the diversity and complexity of living systems require creative, knowledgeable,
                            and imaginative people working in teams of physicians, scientists, engineers, and even
                            business folk to monitor, restore and enhance normal body function. The biomedical engineer
                            is ideally trained to work at the intersection of science, medicine and mathematics to solve
                            biological and medical problems.<br /><br />

                            Biomedical engineers use their engineering and science backgrounds to design the next
                            generation of systems and treatments that will advance the quality of life for patients.
                            They leave an impact through the creation of medical devices that detect and treat disease,
                            the invention of materials that can be used to treat illness in the body, and by designing
                            complex computer models to develop the next generation of disease-fighting
                            drugs.<br /><br />

                            Biomedical engineers are responsible for the creation of artificial organs, automated
                            patient monitoring, blood chemistry sensors, advanced therapeutic and surgical devices,
                            application of expert systems and artificial intelligence to clinical decision making,
                            design of optimal clinical laboratories, medical imaging systems, computer modeling of
                            physiological systems, biomaterials design, and biomechanics for injury and wound healing,
                            among many others.
                            <br /><br />
                            Biomedical engineers respond to societal needs and provide solutions to engineer and a
                            better and healthier world.

                            <p> The department of biomedical engineering has laboratories that are one of a kind and
                                well established. The facilities offered in the laboratories have been increased over
                                the years from the time of establishment of the department. The labs are all filled with
                                hi-tech equipments that up-to-date with industry based technology. All the laboratory
                                courses are taught well using the infrastructure. Augmented experiments are also taught
                                to students on selected areas of specialization which are important to core biomedical
                                engineering. This helps the students in doing additional experiments other than the
                                regular curriculum. The department provides lab facilities after college hours to
                                students who are interested in working on their innovative ideas or projects. To assist
                                students and help them in their aspirations, highly knowledgeable lab assistants are
                                also present always. The labs in the department cater to the needs of students looking
                                forward to a career in the core industry.<br><br>

                                <strong>The department has the following labs:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Electronic circuits laboratory</li>

                            </ul><br>
                            Since the department offers PG in Medical Electronics, there is a separate lab for PG
                            students which are equipped with state-of-equipments and students use it for regular courses
                            and also for doing their PG project work. The department encourages and guides the students
                            to do in-house projects to inculcate the habit of research.
