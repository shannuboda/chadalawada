                Apart from serving in industries, mechatronics engineers can establish their own business/firm/ company for study, design, implementation and maintenance of automation for various industries
                <br>
				<br />
                <strong>MECHATRONICS ENGINEERING IN INDIA</strong> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are also good automotive and industries/ companies where students can find their job opportunities as mechatronics has a great share over changing the direction of automotive developments. For example engine management system, anti-lock braking and ignition. Now students must be aware of news India making ABS mandatory in upcoming years. Now such changes will hope for those who are willing to make a career in this field
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Reason,
                        <br><b>-</b> India has a big market for automotive.
                        <br><b>-</b> Automotive has big scope for mechatronics technology incorporation.
                        <br><b>-</b> There will be the great potential of getting Engineering services jobs for foreign companies as they are looking for Indians as smart/intelligent people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even if you are looking for business this is a good choice because you can make value-added products and electro-mechanical components have a higher profit margin compared to plain mechanical/electrical products.
                    </li>
                </ul>
