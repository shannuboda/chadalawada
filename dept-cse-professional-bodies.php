          <h4>ACM - Association for Computing Machinery</h4>
          <p>
            ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and professional networking. <br><br>
            Founded at the dawn of the computer age, ACM’s reach extends to every part of the globe, with more than half of its nearly 100,000 members residing outside the U.S.  Its growing membership has led to Councils in Europe, India, and China, fostering networking opportunities that strengthen ties within and across countries and technical communities.  Their actions enhance ACM’s ability to raise awareness of computing’s important technical, educational, and social issues around the world. <br><br>
            Rajalakshmi Engineering College functions closely with ACM Chennai Chapter. Several technical activities are organized under the wing of ACM. Students and Faculties are active members of ACM Chennai Chapter. The wing motivates the students towards grooming their career.

          <h4>IEI Student Chapter (The Institution of Engineers – India)</h4>
          <p>
            The Institution of Engineers (India) [IEI] is the largest multi-disciplinary professional body of engineers, established in 1920 with its Headquarters located in Kolkata and incorporated under Royal Charter on 9th September, 1935 by the then His Majesty of King George V. <br><br>
            At REC, Department of Computer Science and Engineering is member of IEI student chapter and many activities are conducted under the umbrella. The activities are mainly focussed on grooming the engineering skills. Reverse Coding was  conducted to increase the student’s interest on coding and improve their logical thinking ability. The Salesman contest was hosted to bring up one startup idea and then to advertise the product and promote branding and marketing. The quiz was conducted as an online interactive session on kahoot and it was based on the emerging technologies and recent trends. These events were organized to inspire the students to actively participate in all the activities which will enhance their skills on different fields. Other than these several guest lectures are conducted to hone the skill set of students. How to write effective research paper was one of the guest lectures that was organized. It was aimed to increase the interest of students towards writing papers effectively. <br><br>
