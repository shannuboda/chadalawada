<h1 class="page-title">Employability Training Camp</h1>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <p>
   The Employability Training Camp is a unique one of a kind value addition programme offered to our students from the Second year onwards. This camp, which is run on a residential mode is offered completely free of cost. It is a matter of pride that this programme is one of the premier events in the Institution and every student looks forward eagerly to be part of this event.<br /><br />

The students who are part of the camp are put through a set of pre-camp screening tests and their exact training requirements mapped. Following the Ice Breaker session on the inaugural day, our expert trainers who are the best in the Industry put our students through their paces through a uniquely developed curriculum, which is aligned towards the ever-changing demands of the Corporate.
<br /><br />
The students are also continuously monitored for their performance with daily online tests, camp diary etc and corrective actions are implemented immediately. The students also have the benefit of interacting with top executives from various industries on a daily basis in "Meet the Industry" programme conducted every evening. In this way every student is given the opportunities to understand the difference between an academic ambience and the corporate reality. The camp also serves as a platform for students to learn and practice Yoga as every morning session starts with a lengthy but useful Yoga session to help them manage the stress levels built up during the course of the camp stay. In this way the residential Employability Training Programme facilitates the student to become employable by the Industry.<br /><br />

Three such Employability Training Camps are conducted for every student before Campus recruitments begin. Also the Camps are followed up effectively with regular web enabled online tests. This ensures that enough opportunities are provided for the students to pick up the trails of employability and thereby secure his/her placement in the Campus. The Employability Training Camps have resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of students getting recruited over the past five years, thereby catapulting REC into a different league to Top notch Institutions preferred by the vast majority of student community.<br /><br />

<!--
The third edition of the Employability Camp for the final year MBA students of Rajalakshmi Engineering College was held from 23rd July 2010 to 28th July 2010. Around 50 students took part in the program. The students were trained on communication skills and problem solving skills. There were also outdoor sessions on team building, creativity and goal setting which included activities like trekking, scavenge hunt, treasure hunt etc. By the end of the programme, the students felt that they were equipped to face the corporate challenges that lay ahead of them.

<h3><strong>1. Soft skills</strong></h3><br>
There are many soft skills that one should possess such as :
<ul>
<li>Public Speaking Skills</li>
<li>Leadership Qualities</li>
<li>Problem-Solving capability</li>
<li>Out of box thinking</li>
<li>Effective utilization of Time</li>
<li>Emotional Quotient</li>
<li>Adaptability to changing work environment</li>
<li>Participation in Teamwork</li>
<li>Conflict Management</li>
</ul>
In the present context, any job requires a variety of skills and aptitudes, apart from the knowledge and expertise acquired in a specific programme of study, such as Computer Science and Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. A graduate has to possess not only multi –disciplinary awareness but also skills that would match many challenging situations that arise time to time, due to ever expanding expectations of the industries as well as the society. The resume, a job aspirant prepares should reflect his/her soft skills, apart from the pure academic distinction, so that the interview and the selection go on smoothly, in this competitive job seeking scenario and ends in a dream placement.

<h3><strong>2. Language and Communication Skills</strong></h3><br>
These days proficiency in written and spoken English has become very essential in any profession. Apart from the advantage to show as an effective team member and also communicating with higher-ups, this expertise, enhances the self-confidence to work with an optimistic outlook. This skill should be developed from the school days and certainly be improved during the college days. In our autonomous institution, the curriculum itself contains theory and laboratory oriented courses in Technical English.
Apart from this, as a part of extra-curricular activities, there are Atrium and debating union of our college functioning in a very organised way, conducting periodically debating and elocution competitions among students, under the guidance of the faculty members handling courses on English in the Department of Humanities &amp; Sciences.
Besides, opportunities are given to students to learn other languages, to learn the new developed technology and also to serve the society speaking different languages.

<h3><strong>4. Awareness of Trends in Technology</strong></h3><br>
An awareness on the recently developing technology in one’s field specialisation and allied fields is essential, even if there is no mention of that in the curriculum. In fact, an Engineering student should be curious to know what are present trends in design and manufacturing of any products in any industry, including medicine and agriculture so that, he/she can explore the possibilities of enhancing the concerned processes, by introducing his/her own innovative engineering concepts.<br>
This also enables and opens opportunities after passing out of the programme in launching on start- ups in emerging fields. This can be considered as the example of the best outcome of such awareness during student days.<br>
Our college emphasises technology trend awareness among students in the following ways:<br>
<ul>
<li>Arranging guest lectures by industrial experts to discuss the recent developments in their specialisation.</li>
<li>Conducting professional society activities.</li>
<li>Interacting with them while undergoing internships and asking them to give a presentation at the end to assess how far they have absorbed the new trends.</li>
<li>Encouraging and guiding students in innovative projects, apart from the curriculum specified ones.</li>
<li>Motivating students to prepare and present papers in national and international conferences.</li>
</ul>
