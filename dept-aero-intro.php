                        <p>
                            The department of Aeronautical Engineering was established in the year 2005, offers 4 year
                            B. E programme with an intake of 60. The Department cherishes the hope that its graduates
                            will be the leaders of tomorrow. The goal of the B. E. program in Aeronautical Engineering
                            is to train the students in a broad based manner with equal focus on applications in
                            aircraft engineering, rocket and space technology. The curriculum is designed to impart
                            engineering knowledge in topics such as structural mechanics, aerodynamics, propulsion, and
                            space dynamics. Further provision exists to acquire additional engineering knowledge through
                            electives. Besides, the students acquire sufficient knowledge in mathematics, physics and
                            chemistry under the category of basic sciences and in humanities and engineering arts. The
                            importance of computational-skill enhancement through the development of one’s own programs
                            as well as the use of advanced software is stressed throughout.
                            <br><br>
                            The department is equipped with the best infrastructure and state of the art modern high
                            tech laboratory facilities such as; Aircraft Propulsion Lab., Aerodynamics Lab. (Low Speed
                            Wind Tunnel Facility), Aircraft Structures Lab., Aircraft Simulation Lab. and Design,
                            Modelling and Analysis Lab. (equipped with licensed software viz ANSYS and Catia) catering
                            to B.E. Aeronautical Engineering curriculum as well as to undertake Research activities. The
                            laboratories and workshops, detailed in the curriculum, have been framed to take up the
                            challenges in Industry and focus themselves on research and development.
                            <br><br>
                            Graduates in Aeronautical Engineering can seek employment in civil aviation, defence R&D
                            laboratories, space research organizations, and CSIR laboratories. Aerospace graduates are
                            also preferred by software industries engaged in engineering-software developments. In
                            addition to these, graduates can enter general fields like management and civil services.
                            Those having a flair for higher education and research can pursue M. Tech. and Ph.D. Tie-ups
                            with the pioneering organisation like National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Indian Space
                            Research Organizations (ISRO) etc., have served as eye-openers on the complexities of real
                            life problems, both for the students and faculty members. A dedicated project work is taken
                            up by every student for two semesters during final year. The project work is aimed at high
                            quality standards used in current industry practices. Some Project works are also supported
                            by leading MNCs and defence laboratories involved in state of art research and development.

                            and Development Organization (DRDO), National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Aeronautical
                            Development Establishment, Aeronautical Development Agency, Civil Aviation Department etc.
                            The Defence services such as Indian Air Force (IAF), Indian Navy (IN), and Indian Space
                            Research Organisation (ISRO) also happen to be three major employers.<br /><br />
                            This course trains an engineer in designing, constructing, analyzing, testing, developing
                            and manufacturing of commercial and military aircrafts, missiles and spacecrafts.
                            Aeronautics focuses on systems that operate on the earth's atmosphere and astronautics on
                            those operating in space. Aerospace engineers design, develop, test, and help manufacture
                            commercial and military aircraft, missiles, and spacecraft. They develop new technologies in
                            commercial aviation, defense systems, and space exploration.

                            In tune with the vision of the college to bring out globally competent professionals with a
                            commitment to serve the society, the budding engineers of REC are faithfully involved in
                            community services through voluntarily asked to undergo Personality and Character
                            Development Programmes for a minimum period of 80 hours. There are two wings to this
                            programme and students may choose one club from each wing. One wing consists of pan national
                            groups like ENACTUS, NSS, YRC, ROTARACT, CII-YI and NSO while the other wing is made of
                            college level clusters like Debating Union, Atrium, Yaazh Mandram, Ethics Club, EDC and
                            STEM. Their contributions are appreciated by the voluntary organizations.

                            <strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> – Students’ entrepreneurial skills are honed through
                            Entrepreneurship Development Cell (Kriya), which also helps the economically weaker students
                            to ‘earn while they learn’. The EDC has brought in various innovations and the students work
                            for it with commitment and dedication. The EDC guides them to apply for external funds and
                            patents. EDC of the college functions in collaboration with National Entrepreneurship
                            Network and CII.
