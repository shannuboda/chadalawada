The lab also supports more advanced experiments in signals and systems, communications, electromagnetism, and photonics. Senior design and project students use the lab on an open basis, and several freshman EK131/132 modules are held here. A small parts window sells common discrete components. Cadence SPB\OrCAD software supports SPICE circuit simulations and schematic capture and PCB layout. Engineering students may generally use the PC stations during open lab times.</td>

                <p>
                    <strong>Vision : </strong>
                    <br>
                    To be a centre, carrying out innovative research work and creating new knowledge enabling the, installation and operation of Renewable Energy systems for various applications, ultimately leading to the large scale replacement of conventional energy installations
                    <br>
                    <strong>Mission : </strong>
				</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To design highly reliable and cost effective wind energy and solar energy electric conversion ( WEEC and SEEC) systems, build and test prototype models</li>
                    <li>To bring out most appropriate Power Electronic circuits for field operation of WEEC , SEEC and hybrid systems</li>
                    <li>To take up consultancy projects in Renewable Energy systems and enable start-up units in this area.</li>
                    <li>To offer systematic training to academicians and industry personal in the design and operation of Renewable energy systems.</li>

                <strong>History of COE-RES in REC: </strong>
                <br>
                This Centre of Excellence in Renewable Energy systems is the long-term dream of the department of Electrical. We concentrated many students project in the field of PV Sourced power generation for commercial, multi-storage and residential buildings in the year 2016. This kind of initiation gives the road map to Renewable Energy Lab in our department. Then the association of many faculties of our department and funded project and relationship with industrial and technical persons we valued now with this outcome. This COE- RES is started in the mid of 2020-2021. Now we are supporting our stake holders in the form of knowledge sharing and initiating research possibilities.
                </p>

                <br>
                The RES Centre has the knowledge and infrastructure to harness renewable energy and it has integrated following multi domain activities:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research scholars, UG and PG students undertake research works and publish the papers in SCI, Scopus and web of science indexed journals </li>
                    <li>Promotes Consultancy projects in renewable energy based multi domain areas</li>
                    <li>Conducts the training programmes, hands on workshops and webinars for both academic and business communities </li>
                    <li>Generates Intellectual Properties (IP) in terms of patents and high-quality technical publications.</li>
                    <li>Promotes the energy audit programme in Industrial, commercial multi storage and residential buildings.</li>
                </ul>
